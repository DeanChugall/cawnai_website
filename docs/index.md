  name: "CAWN V21"
  text: "Continuous Acoustic Wave Networks"
  tagline: A pure linear-time O(L) sequence model that completely discards the O(L²) Transformer Attention wall. Infinite context, flat VRAM.

features:
  - title: 🌊 Holographic Phase Binding
    details: Keys and Values are mathematically bound via angular addition. Destructive interference unpacks exact historical values in O(1) time, solving the SSM "Needle In A Haystack" degradation.
  - title: 🚀 Flat VRAM O(L) Scaling
    details: 100% Custom Fused Triton kernels process the continuous complex domain entirely within SRAM. Scales identically from 512 to 2,000,000 tokens with zero quadratic explosion.
  - title: ⚙️ Hybrid Muon-AdamW Routing
    details: 2D structural projections undergo Newton-Schulz orthogonalization via Muon, while fragile 1D phase gates are insulated in AdamW. Brutally stable continuous optimization.
